Project Description:

Euchre is a trick-taking card game played with an altered deck of 24 playing cards (9s, 10s, Jacks, Queens, Kings, and Aces). Teams of two players face-off in "tricks," playing their best strategic card based on some key rule factors...

User Manual: 

- The first player will begin as the dealer, dealing five cards to everyone and then dealing one card face-up in the middle of the table.
- After dealing, the trump ordering round begins. The player will be given the choice of whether they want the top-dealt card to be the round's trump. The player may pick up the card, selecting trump or decline and pass to the next player to decide.
- "What is trump?" The suit of the ordered card will be the primary trump suit or the "right bower." Jacks are the trump card for the declared suit. The second most valuable card is the Jack of the other suit with the same color, known as the "left bower." For example, If hearts is trump- the Jack of Hearts is the best card and the Jack of Diamonds is the second-best card. Remaining card values follow: Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10. The trump suit will always be of greater value compared to other suits.
- The team that selects trump is known as the "Attackers," while the other team is known as the "Defenders." Round scores will be evaluated on attacking/defending tricks scored coordinated with the given scoring table.
- The first team to reach 10 points wins the game!

Euchre came to life using Godotâ€™s GUI Node Hierarchy to create different screens (called scenes) utilizing textures, sprites, labels, timers, submenus, animations, and background music!
Highlights of coding in GDScript include scene transitions, deck and hand arrays containing cards, trump card selection, card-in-hand selection, card evaluation logic, scoring logic, and memory handling.

Installation Manual: 

- Euchre uses the mouse for button and card selection and the spacebar to pause when in the table scene.
- Download and extract the .zip file from the releases tab of the Euchre GitHub page and run Euchre.exe to begin playing.
